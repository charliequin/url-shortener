## url-shortener
This is a URL Shortener built using React and the Bitly API.

To get started, navigate into the ``client`` folder and run ``npm i`` or ``npm install`` to download all of the applications dependencies.

Then navigate to ``config.js`` and replace ``export const TOKEN = '<YOUR BITLY ACCESS TOKEN>'`` with your access token.

Once you have all that configured, run ``npm start`` from your terminal and the application will run at **localhost:3000**.
